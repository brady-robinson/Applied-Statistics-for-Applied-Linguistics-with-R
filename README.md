# Appled Statistics for Applied Linguistics with R

This course begins with R fundamentals and proceeds through inferential statistics and classical test theory. Files in this repo represent the raw code that accompanies a series of how-to videos for doing applied statistics in R with Applied Linguistics examples. I worked on this project with Dr. Payman Vafaee at Columbia.
